In this game you are supposed to get as far as you can,
and the you get a score based on how far you make it with in the 
time. you will also loose when you hit the obstecals("the holes")

To move you have to alternate between "D" and "L" and to jump
over the obstecals you have to hold "Space" to chage you jump,
you can charge it for 1 second at most but if you are moving
fast enoght with "D" and "L" you might be able to just click it.

buttons: D,L and Space.

Recomende to play it in normal browser window, 
changing the hight of the window does meke things look wierd.
if it to easy i recomend putting the console on the rightside
and then the bigger you make it the harder the games becomes.
